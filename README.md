# Java Secure Web Application
We can create a website with static HTML pages but when we want information to be dynamic, we need web application.

## Web Server and Client
A web server is a computer system that serves web pages to clients over the internet. The client, on the other hand, is the web browser used to request and receive web pages.

## HTML and HTTP
HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is used to structure web pages and display content, while HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is used to transmit data over the internet.

## Understanding URL
URL (Uniform Resource Locator) is the address of a specific web page or resource on the internet. It specifies the protocol used, the server name, and the path to the resource.

## Why we need Servlet and JSPs?
Servlets and JSPs (Java Server Pages) are used to build dynamic web applications that can process user input and generate dynamic web pages.

## First Web Application with Servlet and JSP
This section will guide you through the process of creating your first Servlet and JSP-based web application, including setting up the development environment and writing the code.

## Web Container
A web container is a component of a web server that provides the runtime environment for running servlets and JSPs. Apache Tomcat is a popular open-source web container.

## Web Application Directory Structure
This section outlines the standard directory structure of a Java web application, including the location of servlets, JSPs, and other resources.

## Deployment Descriptor
The deployment descriptor, also known as web.xml, is an XML file that defines the configuration of a web application. It specifies the servlets, JSPs, and other components of the application, as well as their mapping to URLs.
